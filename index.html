	<h1>BODYCOMBAT</h1>
	<hr width="10%" size="3"><br>
	BODYCOMBAT is an energy-packed mix of martial arts moves that will get you fit, fast and strong—and 
	leave you feeling fierce and empowered.<br><br>
	BODYCOMBAT features a scientifically backed combo of some of the most empowering and effective martial arts moves. 
	The addition of motivating instructors and amazing music is what pushes you to your true training potential. The workout 
	is based on the science of Cardio Peak Training, which involves maintaining your heart rate at an aerobic training base 
	(between 60 and 80 percent of your maximum heart rate) with interspersed peaks of intensity (pushing you to 85 to 90 
	percent of your max). This specific blend of steady-state and high-intensity builds cardio endurance and also drives 
	the transformative fat-burning effects associated with high-intensity interval training.<br><br>
	BODYCOMBAT features moves from karate, taekwondo, boxing, muay Thai, capoeira and kung fu. But don’t fret, you don’t 
	need any martial arts experience—during the warm-up, you’ll be coached through all the different movements. You can 
	expect to power through invigorating sets of hooks, jabs and uppercuts, and there are plenty of kicks and high knees, 
	too. You’ll also benefit from functional training moves such as lunges, squats and push-ups.<br><br>

	you are super fit or totally uncoordinated, Konga is for you! With fresh choreography, new technique & the latest music every 
	month you will never hit a plateau or get bored!<br><br>
	
	A one hour Konga class can burn over 700 calories due to the “switch-up” formula and the sustained high intensity nature of the workout. 
	The class can even have you burning calories for several hours after as your body expends energy to return to your pre-workout Jungle Body.<br><br>

	<h1>POWERSTEP</h1>
	<hr width="10%" size="3"><br>
	Step aerobics is the original aerobics style, distinguished from other types 
	of aerobics by incorporating an elevated platform (the “step”) to increase your 
	cardio workout and lower the strain on joints and muscles.<br><br>
	Choreographed routines provided by our professional instructors here at Love Fitness 
	make this class a high-energy cardio workout, and suitable for men and women of all ages 
	and size.<br><br>
	The "step" is a 4-inch to 12-inch raised platform. You step up, around, and down from the platform 
	in different patterns to boost your heart rate and breathing, and strengthen your muscles.<br><br>
	Step aerobics moves range from simple to advanced. The most basic is a step-up, step-down. Once you get 
	more experienced, you do moves that take you over the top and around the step forwards, sideways, and backwards.<br><br>
	Most people take step aerobics classes at a gym, with an instructor showing you each move. The instructor 
	and the upbeat music motivate you to keep going.<br><br>
	Your class will start with a warm-up, followed by choreographed routines on the step, and a cooldown at 
	the end. In some classes, you'll use hand weights for strength-training moves off the step.<br><br>

	<h1>Zumba</h1>
	<hr width="10%" size="3"><br>
	Zumba is a high-energy combination of dance and aerobic exercises drawn from Latin American music, 
	hip-hop beats, Bollywood movies and belly-dancing techniques. <br><br>
	Zumba specifically targets abs, thighs, arms, and bums, as well as providing a great cardio workout to keep you fit and toned.<br><br>
	Zumba is a total-body cardio and aerobic workout, which provides a large calorie consumption. A study shows that a person burns 
	300 to 900kcal with an hour long Zumba exercise.<br><br>
	Because Zumba offers different options, proponents of the Zumba program claim that it is safe for all ages, meaning that anyone 
	from age 0 to 100 can participate in this form of aerobic exercise. Some of the classes are specifically aimed at elderly people, 
	to help them build strength, improve motion and posture, and socialize.<br><br>
